What?
This python website can draw a right angle triangle, calculate the equation of straight line and distance between two points. 

Why?
I built this website because I want to practise and learn more for my mathematics exam. It can help you and others for homework or doing revision. 

How?
I use turtle for drawing right angle triangle, streamlit for simple website and multiprocessing for the turtle to move in another window. I also have made all the calculations inside a file called math_function.py.
